title: "DataSHIELD CADSET Workshop"

# Introduction

This website hosts the materials and exercises for the DataSHIELD workshop for the CADSET project. On it you will find reading materials, setup tutorials, workshop indications and practical exercises.

The workshop is organized by [Bioinformatics Research Group in Epidemiology (BRGE)](https://brge.isglobal.org) from the [Barcelona Institute for Global Health (iSGlobal)](https://isglobal.org).

# Getting Started

All practical exercises will be conducted using multiple servers including the [public Opal demo server](https://opal-demo.obiba.org/), ISGlobal, Imperial College London, and Groningen University servers. These servers provide fully functional DataSHIELD environments with CADSET datasets that workshop participants can use to replicate the examples.

Login credentials and server details are provided in the workshop materials.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the workshop, participants need to have the following software installed on their computers:

### 1. RStudio Installation

Make sure you have **RStudio** installed on your computer. If you don't have it yet, download it from:
- **[Download RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)**

### 2. Rtools Installation (Windows users only)

Windows users need to install **Rtools** to compile packages from source:
- **[Download Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)**

*Note: Mac and Linux users typically don't need this step as they have the necessary tools built-in.*

### 3. Required R Packages

Once you have RStudio and Rtools (if needed) installed, open RStudio and run the following commands to install all required packages:

```r
# Essential development tools
install.packages('devtools')

# Core DataSHIELD packages
install.packages('DSI')
install.packages('DSOpal')

# Additional required packages
install.packages("https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/panelaggregation/panelaggregation_0.1.1.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = 'source')

install.packages('dsBaseClient', repos=c(getOption('repos'), 'http://cran.datashield.org'), dependencies=TRUE)

install.packages("metafor")
devtools::install_github("timcadman/ds-helper")

# Armadillo connection packages
install.packages("MolgenisArmadillo")
install.packages("DSMolgenisArmadillo")
```

**⚠️ Important Notes:**
- Package installation may take several minutes
- If you encounter any errors during installation, please contact the workshop organizers
- Make sure you have a stable internet connection during package installation
